# Discord-Dashboard

Welcome to the Discord-Dashboard repository! This repository was made with the intention of replicating a similar layout and website structure to the discord on the web.

Made using vanilla:

- HTML
- CSS
- A little Javascript

# About

I chose discord as a target of replication as it seemed quite complex at first glance but feasible with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. They also have chrome dev tools disabled so without more research I am unable to just copy the code from the site itself, training my ability to replicate a design just from seeing it.

An idea of the general layout:

![Discord General layout](./discord-template.svg "Discord Layout")

Note that this image was not used as the basis for the website, how the website appears on my personal discord account was used so there maybe some discrepancies.

# Features

- UI elements that do not have much functionality
- The Icons on the side bar expand when hovered over just like the real thimg
- Partially responsive - When screen size is reduced part of the nav bar slides behind the other part
